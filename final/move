				Moving About

	You can move about the field in any of eight directions from 
	your current position by using the keys centered around the 'j'
	key:

				y | u | i
				--|---|--
				h |   | k
				--|---|--
				n | m | ,

	However, you will not be allowed to leave the field except from
	the far right edge.
