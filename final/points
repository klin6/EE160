				 Earning Points

	You earn 1 point for each new "SAFE" grid you identify by stepping
	through it.  You also get a bonus of 10 points for making it
	through the miensfeld by stepping out on the far right.  You also
	can earn points for flags. You get 2 points for correctly flagging
	a mine, but you lose 1 point for incorrectly flagging a "SAFE" grid.

	The game ends when you either blow up :-( or safely make it out of
	the miensfeld on the far right :-) or when you successfully flag
	all mines.
