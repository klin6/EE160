				 WELCOME
				   to
				Miensfeld

	You are about to be placed in grave danger.  You are being sent
	into the Miensfeld, a field full of mines.  Your mission is to
	find your way to the other side without blowing yourself up, and
	map the field in the process. Your predecessors have already mapped
	part of the field for you before meeting their untimely ends.  You
	do have a few tools to help you.  Your proximity probe will 
	display how many mines are in your immediate area as you step into
	each grid on the field.  You also carry a set of flags you can 
	plant to show grids where you suspect there might be a mine.  For
	more information, or to begin, choose from the menu below:
