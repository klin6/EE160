				Planting Flags

	You can plant one of your flags in any of eight directions from
	your current position by using the shifted keys centered around
	the 'J' key:

				Y | U | I
				--|---|--
				H |   | K
				--|---|--
				N | M | <

	You will receive 2 points if you plant a flag on a mine, but you
	will lose 1 point (and the flag) if you plant it in an empty grid.
