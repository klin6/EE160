/*algorithm for round.c: 
//declare variable
	1)float input as prompted input
	2)int integer as new integer value
//printf & scanf as prompting user for a float value
//while loop to loop the inputed float into rounding into a integer 
	1)if loop when input is less than and equal to 0 then the float will round down
		//else the input will round down
	2)print out rounded float
	3)when user enter 0 then system will quit
//return 0
*/

/*algorithm for cell.c:
initialize the minutes and seconds
while there are more minutes and seconds to proccess
get the minutes and seconds
calculate the minutes and seconds into just minutes
print minutes seconds
accumulate the Jog price
accumulate the Jog minutes
accumulate the Holo-T's minutes
get the minutes and seconds for the next call
compute the Holo-T price
print the results
*/

/*algorithm for regress.c:
initialize the sigma computations and n
print " P=[yfirst," "
get the value for the first x and y
update the sigma computation
while there are more x and y to process
update the sigma computation
update n
print ",y value"
get the number of next x and y value
print " ]"
print the results

/*Bonus:
After going into ~ee160 directory the file that can be edited is titled
"dummy." Everything else is readonly files or directory's.
